"# RealStreetRacing" 
This python script was written by me to scrape the details
of various auto parts of the manufacturer "Honda" from the 
website "realstreetperformance.com". Run honda.py first 
to gather all of the links of each honda auto part. Then, 
run details_extractor.py which takes each link and 
scrapes all of the details of each part and writes it to
the pipe delimited file "details.txt"
