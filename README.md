"# RealStreetRacing" 
This python script was written by me to scrape the details
of various auto parts of a specific manufacturer(user input) from the 
website "realstreetperformance.com". The code can be found in "details_extractor.py". 
This code implements multi-threading as well to make the scraper more efficient.
